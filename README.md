# Library
Library app build
This is a follow through library webapp build. Its functionality are to know the books available, get books details as well as author of book's details.
This will help people who want to use the library to know to go to the library or not when they know if the book they want is available or not.

Full Credit to Mozilla.org for the tutorial in teaching this. I learnt a whole lot while building the author list pages and authour detail pages myself using Django. Django is increasingly becoming intresting by the day. I also built some more pages myself following the challenge yourself session
